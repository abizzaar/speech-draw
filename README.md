# Expanded Ideas For Drawing

As a final project for my Art class, I made an interactive digital experience that exposes a voice UI for someone to create a drawing. View the live version [here](https://abizzaar.github.io/speech-draw/)

### Technologies
[Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) and [Artyom.js](https://sdkcarlos.github.io/sites/artyom.html)

### Voice Commands
For example, I would say "Start" to start drawing, "Blue" to change the color, and "Large" to increase line thickness.

| Category      | Commands      |
| ------------- |---------------| 
| Drawing       | Start, Stop   |
| Colors        | Red, Yellow, Blue  |
| Line Thickness | Small, Medium, Large   | 
| Line Opacity  | Faint, Light, Dark   | 

### Limitations
Browser support and device compatibility is not great. It's only guaranteed to work with Google Chrome on laptop and desktop. Make sure to "Allow" the website to use your microphone, and that no other tab or window is currently using the microphone.
